# LeopardTrails
LeopardTrails is an iOS application which targets to identify the of leopards in Srilanka. 

### Why This was Required?

> “During the last two decades, identification of individual animals has been widely recognised as a vital component of modern wildlife research. Individual identification provides a non-invasive, simple, and inexpensive means of following animal movements and behaviour. This, over a period of time, provides information of the area or home range the animal uses, and in turn, assists wildlife researchers to determine the area required by the species for its survival. Individual identification studies also provide an insight to individual animal behaviour, which can be distinctly different from the accepted and known behaviour of the species as a whole. These studies also provide a range of other important data such as, the spacing of litters, age of cub dispersal, and lifespan in the wild.”
> - Late Dr. Ravi Samarasinha (One of the leading naturalists in SriLanka)

When a naturalist needs to identify a leopard spotted in a national park, the means of identificating the leopard is based on the experiance and the guessworks which may lead to invalid conclusions.
